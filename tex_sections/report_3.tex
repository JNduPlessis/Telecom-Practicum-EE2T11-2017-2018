\subsection*{Report 3}

	In figure \ref{figure:2_1}, time and frequency domain plots of three audio signals are shown. The frequency domain plots where obtained using the MATLAB function \verb+fft+. The frequency spectrum is symmetrical around the DC component $f = 0 \si{\hertz}$. The symmetry is a result of the discrete fourier transform, which is complex conjugate symmetric. Plotting only the positive frequencies would be a logical choice, since no information is lost. The used MATLAB script can be found on page \pageref{matlab_2.1}.
